This site was created for training purposes with ASP.NET Core MVC and SignalR
The site was not intended for commercial use. As a result, the site has a number of bugs.
- Technical appearance.
- The VideoLibrary library for downloading files from YouTube apparently has not been supported by the creator for a long time and therefore problems may occasionally arise with downloading certain quality options.
